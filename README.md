To this folder I have planned to collect the pre-assigments for applied work places each in own subfolder.
## bcmvanalyzer (Bitcoin Market Value Analyzer)
This was my application for Vincit Rising Star pre-assigment (december 2021). The idea is to give historical from and to dates to examine best days for selling or buying bitcoins and then travel to those days with time machine to make deals. If trend between dates is only downwards the app should tell not to sell or buy. The client for this assigment was Scrooge McDuck and person responsible for the time machine was Gyro Gearloose. The market value for bitcoins is fetched from CoinGeckos api. I have used React, JavaScript, Hmtl and Css to complete this app. Here you can test my application https://ennakkoteht.herokuapp.com/ (be patient it will take a while to wake up if it is not already running ;-)). And yes, I know that I have a little problem with not sell or buy when the granularity of the historical data change (see CoinGecko's API).
